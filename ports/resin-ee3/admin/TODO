TODO

* resin-ee3ctl should work like apachectl: move parameters from resin3.sh to
  resin-ee3ctl (reported by Arcadius Ahouansou)
* Upgrade to 3.0.4
* mod_caucho.so conflicts between ports if WITH_APACHE[2]
* app-default.xml conflicts with resin3
* clean */WEB-INF/work and empty dirs when deinstalling
* Pid file not removed when issuing resin.sh stop
* Support for OPTIONS


RESIN KNOWN BUGS

* Resin does not stop after "resin.sh stop".  A KILL signal seems to be necessary.
* Log files seem to be closed when app is reloaded


LONG TERM

* deinstall fails (files not deleted WEB-INF/work, cache, log, etc)
* disable srun if run standalone ant httpd if srun
* use contrib/init.resin
* redirect access and error log to /var/log?
* xml declaration in resin.conf
* copy dir: cd /usr/ports/www/mozilla-devel/work/mozilla/dist/bin \
&& /usr/bin/find . |  cpio -pdm -L -R root:wheel /usr/X11R6/lib/mozilla-devel
* what does exactly <log id='/log' href='stderr:' against -stdout and -stderr?
* why resin/log always created?
* cache in /var/spool?  see squid
* explain why bin/resin not suitable on FreeBSD (cannot bind srun)
* path for 'xsl' and 'lib' dirs cannot be changed???
* 'doc' dir always re-created
* local DTD error => put http :)
* $Id: in comment is an invalid XML name
* docbook support
