TODO

* resin2ctl: pass options as args to "java" command
* install.sh: use MAKE_ENV variables
* mod_caucho.so conflicts between ports if WITH_APACHE[2]
* clean */WEB-INF/work and empty dirs when deinstalling


LONG TERM

* deinstall fails (files not deleted WEB-INF/work, cache, log, etc)
* disable srun port if run standalone
* disable httpd port if run with Apache
* xml declaration in resin.conf
* what does exactly <log id='/log' href='stderr:' against -stdout and -stderr?

* cache in /var/spool?  see squid
* path for 'xsl' and 'lib' dirs cannot be changed???
* 'doc' dir always re-created
* local DTD error => put http :)
